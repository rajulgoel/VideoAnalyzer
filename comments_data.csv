youtube,guys do you really think we fell for the nothingphone3
youtube,intro was fav
youtube,no upi in bangalore  no attention :face_with_tears_of_joy:
youtube,i guess the s24u on sale is going to kills this phone off
youtube,4:56 stopped at tthis time i cant handle this cringe anymore saying ltps is same as ltpo is peak reetardness dislike report
youtube,paid promotion not genuine review at all
youtube,even for 45k there are phones with better processors better consistent camera clean ui and also additional features like ip6869 etc as he said this phone is only for nothing fans even the nothing company ceo said similar
youtube,display processor battery non ultrasonic fp sensor display protection everything about this phone is bad and their design is absolutely trash coming from someone who absolutely loved nothing phone 3a pros design
youtube,you havent talked anything about phone design glyph matrix is good but when you created a legacy and want to carry it forward making this drastic change its just not good i guess i think creating glyph lights is iconic why to remove something iconic if they kept glyph lights and glyph matrix then that would be great improvement
youtube,one would even think twice to buy it at 40k
youtube,pricing is the main reason to get roasted by many
youtube,like whats the point of getting public interest by your phone when your body looks like shit public should approach you  seeing your body or your intellect not your phone please if you are in your right mind do not buy nothing do not take me for a nothing hater because i have been using nothing phone 3a pro and this was the worst purchase of my life  its all design its not best in anything there are phones better at every thing at same price range and biggest of all  its biggest highlight the software nothing os nothing phone 3a pro is still running on may security patch  even old poco and mi devices get security patch update every month and yet get criticized for having worse software experience even though it has one of the best if we know how to debloat the phone and goodbye nothing i am purchasing new poco f7  will never purchase a nothing again
youtube,i love nothing and i would personally be willing to live with the display camera performance and battery compromises only if i could buy this phone for 55k or less for the 512gb variant anything more than that and its a hard sell even for a person like me who has praised nothing for all their phones so far
youtube,there is no bad phone only bad priced phone can be same for gpu
youtube,bruh you liking you it doesnt matter to majority of us its design specs are mid so should be its price we aint dumb to buy something cos of how it looks
youtube,7:22 lmao my sam a54 heats up to 52:face_with_tears_of_joy:  the thermal paste is cooked tho
youtube,i feel  the phone is well designed it will grow on you like pixel 7 did for me price is shit for the product same like pixel 7 launch price
youtube,otter than the processor i think this is something like cmf 2 pro
youtube,you do know that its ok to say you like it right you dont have to copy what others say because you think people will get angry i think its an awesome phone and if i didnt already have a 16 pro max id definitely pick one up
youtube,if youtube havent removed you will understand stand how your audience will react to this:face_with_tears_of_joy:
youtube,nothing3 is good at nothing 3a pro is better
youtube,why does my phone 2 have ltpo  :thinking_face: i only paid half of the price of this phone 2 years ago
youtube,payment received on google pay
youtube,this phone specifies its brand name nothing  :face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy:
youtube,samsung launches their s series phone at 80k but there will be a huge price after 812 months so a person who cant afford 80k can still own that phone at 4050k after some time but that is not the case with nothing so its huge price doesnt make any sense
youtube,4:20 :face_with_tears_of_joy:
youtube,35  40 k :check_mark_button:
youtube,under 80 we can get the s24 ultra which is far away better than this shitttjust matchlesss
youtube,being nothing phone 1 user i was very excited for phone 3 but no glyph sht design and pricing made me not buy this i can compromise with the software because nothing always fixes the bugs but hardware is sht
youtube,nice try diddy :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing::rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
youtube,what is carl pei saying what is in his mind techwiser please ask himonly he knows
youtube,if i were to build a flagship nothing i would have :  modified the white into a metallic grey or silver and not a plastic white apperance one also adding more mettalic finish colours  limit the screen size to atmost 65in to give it a seperate impression for premium cuz already midrange ones are 67inalso no complains for a 5k battery shall remain thn  put a rather 8gen3 instead of a 8sgen4 lagging n flickers would have been rarer
youtube,:red_heart:love da may nothing phone 3:face_with_tears_of_joy:
youtube,0:39 oscar deserving performance from whole team:face_with_tears_of_joy::red_heart:
youtube,dekh rhe ho binod log kitna gir jate hai paiso k chakkar mein:face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy:
youtube,clicbaitwiser
youtube,crap phone you cant sell substandard phone for a price that hefty  its plain bad and whoever says its pricey  you would call alto bad if it was selling at a price of a ferrari  when you spend so much you want the best not just close or fine
youtube,you got a review piece for free dude why the hell do i spend 80k for its few ve points when i have better options
youtube,4:20 ayo :face_with_tears_of_joy:
youtube,what if one can get s25 ultra for nearly the same price in uae i went for the same after waiting for 3 months for nothing phone 3
youtube,2:03 yeah like a tumor :clown_face:
youtube,nice script work
youtube,is pixel 9a a better phone than pixel 9
youtube,i saw the nothing phone 3 and straight bought the red magic 10s pro for cheaper and is 100 better
youtube,for the first half i was thinking how much nothing paid him:face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy:
youtube,software is shit  no transcripts  no text extract or copying text without google lens automatically searching that text and analysing whole image while it can be simple  sentence or sensitive personal info  voice recording no transcripts provided by default no back and forward buttons or gestures in browser u need to get edge browser to access basic quick settings like brightness or rotation or lock rotation for 1 way u either cannot do it or u need to swipe twice  can modify horizontal or vertical sliders  why i cannot fast track through different pages with the dots or slider on home page  whats the point of them  why google pay doesnt ask for verification before paying  anyone on train can just pass by with reader while my phone is unlocked or in suing it and get paid  the apps are not working properly and widgets they dont fit screen properly essential key cant extract text or u cannot select text from screenshots u taken lol  no stacked widgets why  the brightness sensor is so close to edge that it gets triggered and lowers brightness although it is bright  the autofocus sucks on cameras unreliable and no micro shots no they arent better by using telephoto lens bc u just cannot get close enough to objectsso its twice as worst than galaxy or iphone and it needs more light and stabilisation oh right uktawide doesnt have one lol or any laser lidar autofocus help no magnets or massage bc why not  in semi transparent and nothing design would look cool and they are cheap battery not great at all bc processor nm higher  screen not ltpo thus higher power consumption fingerprint scanner limited to one position whatsvtye point of lock screen and not able to interacts with it and face unlock just unsafe  battery again bc bad processor and screen and optimization battery aint great like i dont need too performance at that price etc i want geniuije good fun reliable experience smooth reliable  software and long term  bright screen when i need it for outside and travel  low brightness when at night  great haptics bc workspace and nowadays spinet ringtone but great haptics  no overheating bc many phone do especially outside idk u go with family for holidays so some pictures and vids gps and bright sun and suddenly phone gets supper hot battery drops  brightness drops so bad u cannot see anything so idc most processors are fats enough thus as long as i get smooth reliable experience with good safety and privacy im happy
youtube,this is made for bbd phone they launched it only to sell it for 45000 during diwali sale for whopping 50 off
youtube,the best nothing is budget friendly good os no lag good camera :red_heart:
youtube,why does anyone needs glyph it is jus a gimmick  nobody will use it just like the glyph light
youtube,i would pick samsung s24 ultra instead of this trash  still it will cost me 5k less in sale  it will have overall better experience value performance ui etc i dont know wht nothing guyz were smoking while deciding its price:face_with_tears_of_joy:
youtube,5:00 problem with os is it gets boring fast
youtube,thy thought they are another apple but they forget that they are on same android os which is available on cheaper device
youtube,please dont try to justify this phone just to be on good books with the brand nothing took off with help of indian market but now it betrayed us as if we dont exist for them when asked their response was indians have cheaper alternatives like 3a series this brand not at all deserves our attention please stop making such videos
youtube,at this point of time manchester united jersey selling for 5500 rs is questionable
youtube,the problem isnt design or concept its about the price of the phone and what u get in that price and what its offering u can get absolutely anything at that price point if u want best camera slightly raise the budget and get x200 pro best android software experience get pixel 9 pro unique software experience get samsung and if performance is main priority and an all rounder with good camera design and software get one 13 allrounder compact with good battery and camera get vivo x200fe honestly i prefer last year s24 ultra over nothing 3 it has better camera software support costume service even better performance and optimization better software customisation with good lock better aftersale service better retail value and cherry on top better ecosystem
youtube,if nothing doesnt sell this under 50 k within some months ill change my name legally
youtube,bas iskaa price 4045k kerdoo or flagship tag nikaal do fir sbkoo achaa lageygaa yeh phone :grinning_face_with_sweat:

youtube,nothing became what it hated it literally called out the iphone for being costly and here they are at least iphone is flagship
youtube,day 2 of asking tech wiser to buy me nothing phone 3
youtube,i can forgive them for design but never for the price
youtube,okay tell me one reason to buy this over oneplus 13 i mean its cheaper more fast internals and ofcourse its oneplus :slightly_smiling_face:
youtube,i have s23 256 when i play some games it can go easily 465 degrees in temperature  something

youtube,80k phone sd 8s gen 4 is fine:smiling_face_with_tear::smiling_face_with_tear::smiling_face_with_tear::smiling_face_with_tear::smiling_face_with_tear:
youtube,i was like why were you praising it a lot but then the other half of the video showed me what you truly think  :thumbs_up::thumbs_up::thumbs_up:
youtube,for 80k man fuck emption
youtube,finallyyyy good editing
youtube,without the software there is nothing good about the nothing phone 3 i even consider nothing phone 2 with latest update it still provide a better value then the phone 3 and if the price is 25k for nothing phone 2 with latest update than its shut up and take my money deal
youtube,collab bhi likh lete bhai sahab inta kon chat ta h bhy nothing ki:face_with_tears_of_joy:
youtube,the nothing phone 3 is a very beautiful phone
youtube,nothing walo ne paise diye :full_moon_face:
youtube,how is the os so good its literally boring stock android unlike coloros or hyperos
youtube,its a 60000 phone almost flagship not a full flagship
youtube,bhai ek video samsung galaxy f36 one video will it worth for me
youtube,carl pei ko pel diya prateek pew pewww honestly fair enough points were raised if you compare good points with an iphone then why not compare where you lack behind and they lack behind everywhere except pricing and justifying the shit they made on a youtube video rather than rectifying their fuckery
youtube,now you are just covering up the mess created by nothing  i was a damn hard fan of nothing  but after this phone i hate this shitty phone
youtube,i want to see the sales report of this phone:face_with_tears_of_joy:
youtube,a lot of these comments coming from people who very apparently didnt watch the entire video

youtube,i love my nothing phone cmf nothing 1 :red_heart:
youtube,it is a :pile_of_poo: phone available for f:brain::brain:ls  best choice is pick poco f7 or if you have a budget then go with iqoo neo 10
youtube,40k phone launched at 80k its an absolute shit
youtube,you did not pay for the device   nothing 3a experience was great so this would be even better especially if you dont have to pay for it    if you really like something you show support by buying it as well
youtube,7:10 come on man you didnt get your hands on motorola edge 40 i guess never check it in thermal meter but the game app shows cpu temperature at 50c sometimes if there is no fan  while charging im sure it reaches 60 for sure those metal frame just fries the fingers
youtube,it really looks like nothing was trying very hard to take advantage of indian fans and fanboys in a drastic way :crying_face:
youtube,bugs are there in 3a too exactly the same
youtube,fingerprint scanner is not well placed stop this shit:red_heart:
youtube,honestly oneplus13r is faaar better:face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy:then this shit
youtube,if the price goes down around 4550k  it will still sell like crazyy indian consumers seek value and thats the main reason why this phone is so hated right now :face_with_tears_of_joy:
youtube,i m like it kyu ki mujhe company ki d jo karna hai company next time mobile phone review karne de or hate it subscriber ko bewakuf bhi banana hai :face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy:
youtube,its not about the shitty design that only paid reviewers liked and promotes its about the okish specs that they call flagship level and the most flagshippy pricing :face_with_tears_of_joy:
youtube,is this paid promotion techwiser
youtube,promotion likhna bhul gaya bhai
youtube,the same software is available under 20k phone :expressionless_face::expressionless_face::expressionless_face:
youtube,abey saale
youtube,hot take: i like the design and hate everything else including gliph matrix
youtube,nothing is nothing
youtube,i didnt see anyone talking about nothings environment friendly approach of manufacturing by using recycled material this may be a reason that phones price is high
youtube,you want attention carry this phone youll get stares and a lot of questions
youtube,as carl pei seems he is not very smart he priced it around in a very competitive market what the hell by the before 7:00 i was about to comment completely sponsored video but then i saw the rest completely agree with you
youtube,notathing  :loudly_crying_face: owning the nothing phone 3 is a real conversation starter: hey didnt you pay a lot for that phone yes and look at all the nothing i got
youtube,29999   then i m ready to buy it
youtube,watching this in my nothing phone 1

youtube,4:23 peak
youtube,its a good phone for around 50kbut for 80k nah people will go for samsung or iphone for 80k
youtube,dude atleast add sponsored if youre going to spew sht
youtube,even the diehard nothing fans are switching to other brands after the release of this phone :folded_hands:
youtube,if this shit was priced even 45k i would have give it a thought
youtube,hah bhaiii kitne paise mile
youtube,let us start a movement to make pratik clean shave once hit like if you want it to happen
youtube,i think the main problem is carl not the phone :face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy:he will criticise every other phone and give every possible rational  explanation to why nothing phone has some bug or fault
youtube,same problem sre in old models too
youtube,let me tell you its offtopic but you look like mechanical jugadu very similar face you should check him out lol
youtube,ad wiser

youtube,hindi bol le bhai
youtube,ceo is high when he got the idea to produce a phone at this price:face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy:
youtube,nothing thinks they are apple  people will buy their overpriced products just in name of their brand
youtube,40k phones are offering much better value for money and descent software experience these days this phone is simply wrong
youtube,finally bro got paid
youtube,not gonna lie he had us in the first half
youtube,nobody can convince me to buy this phone
youtube,nothing takes notes from apple for pricing their phones:face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy:
youtube,you trying to get nothign ceos attention with that title i guess lmao
youtube,paytm par 50 prapt huye
youtube,everything is good with the phone its just the pricing that is way off
youtube,you have clearly been paid by nothing to defend this disaster of a phone lets see how it sells my prediction aapki kacchi ho jayegi
youtube,nothing fans are having nothing in their brains :face_with_tears_of_joy::man_shrugging::rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
youtube,exaclty they messed up with the price
youtube,:face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy: are you cray or got paid this phonw is overpriced shit
youtube,yupp you are right with the price and with some offer that should reduce it 5k and then 40k will be best deal and will compete with 1 13r
youtube,1:40 i like collecting clothing tags or stickers that use to come in phones :face_with_open_mouth::grinning_face_with_sweat:
youtube,4:20 you got me
youtube,as they have said a very good phone for 45000 inr and a very bad phone for 80000 inr
youtube,money credited
youtube,its a very good phone at 45k
youtube,if only the processor was 8 elite phone 3 could have been a good phone of nothing
youtube,even 45k is way too much for this phone about rs33000 is its max value
youtube,6:33 twist in story :person_tipping_hand:
youtube,its getting strong competition from the iphone 16e
youtube,1st half : money credited   2nd half : oh it was inr and not usd
youtube,for this phone even for nothing so called premium strategy it shouldnt have been more expensive than 55k and im being too generous here right now even oppo reno 14 pro seems to be more value for money that this phone
youtube,what changed between this short and the full review
youtube,i like the phone too its industrial and the cameras are giving an hint of brutalism love that brave in a market where every company trys to create a design that doesnt offend anyone but also says nothing love the design but the matrix ist lame compared to the lights but still better nicer than normal stuff
youtube,ok but 80k for this why
youtube,most hated iskespecs ke liye nahi hai  gandu  iske price ke liye hai
youtube,people wont gather to cherish the device but to laugh at the pathetic chapri design
youtube,nothing fans crying so hard :face_with_tears_of_joy:
youtube,please do a video on the galaxy watch 8 classic which youre wearing :red_heart:
youtube,there is nothing in nothing 3 phone :face_vomiting::nauseated_face: hyper overpriced :face_vomiting:
youtube,i seriously think the team behind pricing forgot the price sensitivity here a phone made here being that expensive makes no sense it should have come at 5055k before discounts so people would get it at 4548k after discounts it feels someone just for the aesthetic on price page of showcase put it at 79999 to match with 799 across other currencies which if its true is silly and straight up bs honestly i wouldnt be surprised if they did it because they went so far to make a hole on motherboard to reduce 1 camera bump while other 2 were left as it is and for what maybe aesthetics because they wanted this design anyhow of one bump being away and at asymmetrical angle so ye gg you lost your market here on a subjective design and 1 level below specs across the board and that too with buggy software which was the only thing flagship about phone 3  lol
youtube,agree with you its not about the phone in the first place prateek its always about the price it offers no flagship specs at a flagship price
youtube,we need snapdragon elite to future proof the phone  no one buys a flagship to use for 1 year  even if they do use only for 1 year then comes the resale value
youtube,4:20 editor nailed it
youtube,reasons to like the phone: software reasons to hate it: everything else
youtube,editing day by day:chart_increasing::chart_increasing:
youtube,the most hated phone in universe
youtube,8s gen 3 is batter then 8s gen 4 because 8s gen 4 is heater :face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy:
youtube,people are angry because of its price bro
youtube,worst phone only this is
youtube,bro received money from nothing
youtube,sorry but this is not a flagship from any angle samsung has been offering usb 30 display alt since over 5 years now and nothing still doesnt have it in any flagships despite the price  why it matters by 2026 aosp is getting a desktop mode just like samsung dex 2026 is the year when your smartphone finally becomes a full fledged computer that can do stuff on big screen with attached keyboard and mouse when the s21 fe from 2022 will be able to do it but your nothing phone cant your eyes will finally open to the stupid game that carl pei is playing the most expensive samsung phone that doesnt come with usb 30 display alt is a56  so its pricing should be around that phone  meaning somewhere around 30k45k max
youtube,loved the shirt:red_heart:
youtube,you are the only one who talked about why it is important to punch the periscope camera and still the phone got a camera bump seems like nothing just did it for the sake of making the camera module assymetric because if they make symmetrical design then it might look like other brands or in future it might be copied by somebody else so they brought an ugly design which no one even can thought of trying something like that and that makes the design unique   the fanda is  make something unique wheather it is ugly or not functional  dont care  price it high marketing it as desing wonder
youtube,forget the back of the phone look at everything else not worthy of 80k price tag hell its not even worthy of 60k
youtube,who cooked the hand drawn phone 3 9:35
youtube,all the advantage of this phone is for small group of people
youtube,hey guys at nothing aint slowthey know exactly the kind of hype its going to consume if they launched a subpar phone at flagship prices theyre going to slash down the prices aggressively in upcoming days to appeal the online platforms after the hype train passessome companies have done it recentlyany sort of marketing is good marketing goodbad whatever
youtube,phone 3: dead on arrival
youtube,nothing made a nothing phone :grinning_face_with_sweat:
youtube,badnam huye to kya naam na hoga gariyane ke liye hi sahi public unanimous hai
youtube,btw  carl pei said indians are poor so they cant afford a phone like this    still gonna buy it
youtube,nothing phone 3 is a golden:trophy: turd
youtube,:check_mark:here it is :heavy_dollar_sign::heavy_dollar_sign: paid review by nothing :face_with_tears_of_joy:
youtube,kithe paise diye the phone ko like kr ne ke liye
youtube,no way bro you defended that badly placed fingerprint sensor with iphone that nothing can never match iphones os experience camera quality and most importantly brand value  btw i too liked the design :face_in_clouds:
youtube,bro can sell water to the ocean
youtube,most hated phone of the year :face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy:
youtube,i will get it if below 40k
youtube,you are sold at the end you just did damage control by saying if its 45k thumbnail itself is misleading you love the phone
youtube,nothing single handedly made the competition look good at this price point
youtube,kitna mila
youtube,the phone is actually available for 52k so its a fair price for what it offers for those who have the experience of nothings clean software this is going to be an upgrade for nothing 1 and 2 users
youtube,if someone wants to experience nothing os  only those will consider this otherwise oneplus 13 would be a much better choice
youtube,i like the phone no problem only problem is its price  should have been in 37k
youtube,:rainbow_flag::rainbow_flag: accent :rainbow_flag::rainbow_flag::rainbow_flag: review
youtube,i almost typed this is a sponsored video you had me praatik you had me
youtube,nothing did nothing
youtube,people will question why do u even follow man i are you mentally alright bro:face_with_tears_of_joy:
youtube,yes  when u take the phone out  everyone gives u a lot of attention yes thats totally true  they are thinking whats wrong with u :d
youtube,80k im getting an  pixel 9 pro :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:
youtube,is this sponsorshiphuh:face_with_tears_of_joy:
youtube,there should be a sponsorship disclaimer for the entire video
youtube,only bad thing about this phone is the  price no way anyone will choose phone 3 over s24u 75k
youtube,nothing se paise mil gaye  lag raha hai
youtube,went for the mobile shopping for switching back to android after 6 yearsiphone 11 my choices were nothing pixel 9 s25 and there i saw nothing phone 3 and i liked watching between pixel 9 and s24 i was tempted to buy nothing phone 3 but held back and bought s24 ultra
youtube,was using phone 1 wait for phone 3 got to know price 80k sold phone 1 got oneplus 13s simple :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:
youtube,i would say nothing phone 2 was value for money after seeing phone 3
youtube,who cares abt design device is shit for the price
youtube,it seems paid promotion:face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy:
youtube,this is just a experiment by nothing to grab attention and gain brand value next time they will lunch a full fledged flagship above 1lakh with all the flgship hardware and features
youtube,according to you which one should we buy nothing 3a or 3a pro
youtube,nowadays phones are a part of ones personality and like mkbhd said not everyone wants to have a crab:crab: they opt for the lobster:lobster:
youtube,a lot of change from the first review especially first half to the point it feels like its sponsored not sure why was it needed
youtube,glory glory man united:red_heart::white_heart:
youtube,phone is not the problem price is
youtube,sponsorwiser till 6:19
youtube,bro played it smartly first embraced then disgraced then gave an opportunity if it sells at 45000it will be in bbd  its a value for money its still not worth of freaking 45000 bro
youtube,made in india by chinese:face_with_tears_of_joy:
youtube,s24 ultra is 79k right now without offers
youtube,bro what about weight management new z fold is 218gm and this shit is 220gm wtf i think you need a nose protection while using it :face_with_tears_of_joy:

youtube,yes 45k good price for this phone
youtube,4:20 this one got me :face_with_tears_of_joy:
youtube,even public toilets look better than this :red_heart:
youtube,tumhara naam pratik haimera ek dost hai pratik kya tum bdmi mein padhe the kolkata mein  if u have studied i m vivek do u rdmember me
youtube,i bet its a promotional video like pls think about spending 80k on a useless gimicky feature phone when u have way better options in just 50k and its only usp is a totally useless feature  ie the glyph gimick i mean come on nothing u have done nothing on innovation  u made a toy for an adult bcoz i dont think a kid is anyway getting a 80k phone  u should regret on what u have made  and that too selling at a way higher price where everyone expect a flagship experience not a toy
youtube,as a fan of techwiser it is very hard to see the video till 7 mins because thats not you i thought to unsubscribe till that moment later your real style was begun
youtube,damn  video theme is amazing
youtube,bro prateek you almost scared me i was thinking have you gone out of your mind or has nothing paid the right price but thanks to my habit of watching the full video i felt relief nothing 3 is one of the biggest price blunders a company can make what was the ceo thinking when he was finalizing the price people surely need that maal jo usne us din fuka tha :face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy:
youtube,1:35 hoarding symptoms :grinning_face_with_sweat:
youtube,0:20 kya ye intro hai chhii:nauseated_face::face_vomiting:
youtube,id buy it for 60k
youtube,paid promotion nothing else this phon is just ugly
youtube,i was about to write the price 4045k for this phone but then you said the exact fair price 4045k its a coincidence but we can all agree that this phone is sub 50k device period   nothing have really messed up with this phone everything literally everything looks messy 8s gen 4 is a massive power hungry chip while other brands aware of this and they put biggest batteries in the industry nothing have sticked to a smaller battery hoping that their godtier optimization can handle this   i can also go on and on i hope nothing will understand what they have done
youtube,6:03 you can do all of this on the phone with that processor for now but when u buy a phone at that price with 5 years of update it needs to be future proof for that period with a comparatively low powered processor itll definitely affect the apps that it can handle in the next 23 years :man_shrugging_light_skin_tone: oops ai jumped into writing this before watching fullyso agree with all of it at the end :face_with_tears_of_joy:

youtube,rn i was searching for a a good phone at 30k and having this cmf phone 1 as my daily driver i was actually quite impressed with the specs being offered like the 120hz amoled and a potent enough processor to get me through the day with my avg sot being around 7hrs this really solidified the image of nothing in my mind and felt like finally something good and interesting in this price cap now that i have not really encountered much bugs like other people and knowing that the edge 60 pro is a much better phone overall with its camera and all being that much mature in the way of seeing colors but still i would go for the nothing cuz i would not care much at this price point of 30k due to this overall aesthetics the software and especially being the widgets of the music app being a spotify apk works flawlessly some might call it dumb but i feel this brand is here to stay and because of there current size they must be encountering much big of a shipping cost and basic raw material cost which might get way more competitive and better in the future only thing being the 80k price point which shud have been around 60k or 70k at max with a much better camera setup the design is objective person to person but the only thing that shud have stayed shud have been the glyphs and that same screen seen enough videos and reviews from a lot of people actually
youtube,nothing is the new nokia   jaise log nokia ka mzaka udate theey kuch nhi kia tabhi toh nokia   nows it nothing   they did nothing good in the new phone thats why its named nothing   overpriced phones for nothing phone with nothing new nothing matters to carl pei and nothing is just nothing :face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy:

youtube,please review poco f7
youtube,s24 ultra: im still here:smiling_face_with_sunglasses:
youtube,poco f7 video not u  nothing phone 3 :thumbs_down::thumbs_down:80k  ph poco f7 :ok_hand::thumbs_up: 30k
youtube,im a nothing 2a user  ive noticed that whenever nothing tries to enter the upperrange category their pricing becomes completely unreasonable  some good examples are the nothing 2a nothing 3a pro and the latest nothing 3 their future strategy seems inconsistentjust like the design language of the nothing 3a and nothing 3 :face_with_tears_of_joy: the 2a felt like a copypaste product  if the company had a strong wellthoughtout plan they could definitely succeed but decisions like launching the 3a before the nothing 3 or the confusing design choices dont seem like smart moves  another important point: nothing should focus more on indian consumers india is their biggest market yet their marketing and product direction seem overly focused on the us and uk price
youtube,the phone is good but at 80k  it is a hard sell i think they will have to drop the price around 50k in sales in order for people to actually consider buying it i have a 3a pro  the software is great for a phone below 30k but at 80k  i wouldnt even consider phone 3 when there is s24 ultra and oneplus 13 which are actually cheaper than phone 3
youtube,nothing os is obviously better than one ui now
youtube,it worth the price 80k if pixel 9 pro xl worth at 130k
youtube,nice editing :face_with_open_mouth: you clearly worked hard on this video
youtube,simple question: how much nothing did pay you guys :face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy:

youtube,a controversial nothing phonexd:crossed_fingers:
youtube,it doesnt look shit but the pricing is shit which makes the whole phone 3 shit which is actually shit
youtube,you wont believe it but a girl approaches me while i was taking pics  with this masterpiece
youtube,nothingtech carl pei will love it
youtube,i am nothing 3a pro user  i really great experience with this phonebut for nothing 3 everthing is looking great but price should be 50k55k max:red_heart:
youtube,worst priced phone of the year 2025 couldve been around 35k
youtube,this phone looks shit has shitty specs compared to the price if it was a 40k phone people would have bought this even if the design is shit because of the os nothing has been doing really good in terms of their software and everybody loves the os so when you are making a bold move like removing the identity of long and curvy flashlights and also making a shitty design you have to make sure more people can get their hands on the product just so they can experience it themselves and give impressions like yeah the phone feels really good in the price that is when you will have second thoughts like maybe the design is not as bad i initially thought guess that will never happen lol
youtube,they wanna be too unique just be humble and copy iphone bro nothing
youtube,thumbnail se mujhe to lga tha bhai dr nhi lgta apni audiance se :face_with_tears_of_joy:

youtube,when im paying 80k im not okay with fine
youtube,so i took a chance and decided to switch from iphone to androidand i ended up preordering the nothing phone 3 ive been using an iphone for years but i felt like trying something new and different while browsing this one caught my attention  i was honestly surprised by the price compared to other brands but i still went ahead with the preorder because of the freebies offered here in the philippines it comes with the nothing ear 2 in white a cmf 65w charger a nothing lanyard badges and stickers so in a way it feels like i got a discount worth around approx 173  i really hope this turns out to be the right choice i know there are phones out there with better specs but for my everyday use i think this one will be more than enough
youtube,paidwiser
youtube,worst phone of the year
youtube,if it was for 35k then its a sure banger apart from the shttier back design than 3a pro
youtube,no phone is bad until the price tag enters  this one is sht because of the price tag
youtube,4:20 oh hell nahhhh hahahhahhahahahahahaa helpppppppppppppppppppppppp
youtube,the difference between manchester united and nothing company is that manchester was established in 1878 and nothing was founded in 2020 yeah not a big deal  :face_without_mouth::face_without_mouth::face_without_mouth:
youtube,7:51 my guess one reason why it could be expensive in india is that when you sometimes import components and then assemble and export it you get incentives otherwise you dont hence it is more expensive in india
youtube,exactly 4045k would be perfect enough
youtube,the phone is not justified even if it was priced 60k around 40k is the ideal price
youtube,80k for upper mid budget ltps display why :clown_face:
youtube,no answer why high price
youtube,usb 20 ltps display and that low fingerprint scanner position are all dealbreakers

youtube,5:26 it have many issues if you look for the review and the major one is heating and there is no mention of cooling system in nothing  so you can say it is goo to super heated than poco f7 and iqoo neo 10 which have cooling chambers
youtube,feels like one plus 2 but high priced
youtube,defend 75k s24 ultra v 80k nothing phone 3
youtube,4:49 4:51 yeah but in that price range they should provide it  if they are not then what they are providing for the money :money_bag:
youtube,paid video unsubscribed channel today
youtube,i got s25 ultra recently and they had battery issue for a day and post update it is good it did get hot a bit while playing wuthering waves most probably a optimization issue from the game dev end because codm  asphalt has no issue while gaming an hour plus do a full video on s25 ultra i would love to know more about my 1st premium flagship
youtube,4:19 another gimmick that many people will not use
youtube,80 thousand and its just fine
youtube,the only thing hatee about this phone is the price price too high for a mid range phone

youtube,the phone is good  but not for 80k  i would like to choose samsung ultra series over this phone
youtube,majak device by nothing
youtube,2:03 honestly the design shouldnt bother people as long as it provides proper functionality without hindering or causing any problems but this is where nothing fails:face_with_tears_of_joy:
youtube,1:43 yeah appreciate it but is there really need help to disrupt the market then should i put 35 mm jack:grinning_face_with_sweat:
youtube,can you make a video about camera terms like hdr what are pixels and use of periscope camera and all suck geeky things
youtube,usb c port is a 20 port with android 16 google is launching a samsung dex like feature natively built into android and our new 80000 phone wont support it due to hardware limitations great job  :party_popper:

youtube,lets glitching glow was the pun intended
youtube,waiting for someone to buy this instead of s24 ultra:face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy:
youtube,if they put 8s gen4  they could have made price at 40k that solves all the problem
youtube,paid by nothing
youtube,phone is good but not worthy
youtube,good one
youtube,i hope they again target the mid range market and give the flagship features in a mid ranged phone carl did it with one plus initially he needs to do it here as well
youtube,1st half of video :smiling_face::smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes::smiling_face_with_hearts::face_blowing_a_kiss: 2nd half :shaking_face::grimacing_face::face_exhaling::face_with_headbandage::face_with_thermometer::nauseated_face::nerd_face:

youtube,l mera
youtube,wow a flagship where everything is just fine thats what you want
youtube,its overpriced and i think it cant stand out in indian market as there are some better options
youtube,i think its a good smartphone the only thing is it should have been priced between 5060k everyone is praising vivo x200fe at 55k which has similar performance but great camera nothing phone is also same
youtube,there is no good and bad thing in this device the only problem is with its pricing everyone will love and buy it if the price comes under 50k
youtube,pricing is what that makes this phone bad and coming to grabbing eye balls or attention argument there is a difference between the kind of attention shraddha kapoor gets vs the kind of attention urvashi rautela gets and in my opinion nothing phone 3 is the uravashi type attention
youtube,6:43 real review starts here :grinning_face_with_sweat:

youtube,im still a fan of the glyph lighting on the nothing phone 1 and 2 that literally made it different from the other phones and still going to choose from both two rather than choosing this at 80k
youtube,except the processor everything is good but i dont know about 80k good
youtube,nothing phone 3 :clown_face::clown_face::clown_face:

youtube,under 40k makes sense carls gimmicks failed this time
youtube,may be this is a strategy of carl pie like launch it at 80k and then suddenly at a sale drop it till 45k or 50k so that everyone goes ah its a 80k phone you are getting at 45k now damn good deal kind of a strategy
youtube,this phone is an overhyped shit phone and guyz iam a nothing fanboy:crying_face::crying_face:
youtube,day 1 of asking tech wiser to buy me nothing phone 3
youtube,dont make such videos u will loose trust
youtube,lava again 3 did it  way back
youtube,please make a long term review of motorola edge 60 pro
youtube,as a nothing fan i am ready to pay even 1 lakh rupees if nothing provides top of the line specifications  but i would never pay 80000 rupees for a midrange flagship   instead ill buy nothing phone 3a
youtube,1010 ragebait
youtube,payment aa gayi hai :face_with_tears_of_joy:
youtube,guys wait for the second half of the video
youtube,i saw the price tag n i was like thats a huge jump i hope they have added a light saber for that price then i saw the specs let alone about anything else but processor itself made me go :face_with_symbols_on_mouth: i mean i just got a xiaomi 14 civi for 40k with snapdragon 8s gen3 this cant be double of that rest of the phone was meh totally agree that this phone makes sense for 40k not 80k
youtube,i guess i will stick to my nothing phone 1
youtube,glad i waited for the review before commenting earlier thanks
youtube,dear mr carl pei  you either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain  nothing phone 3 is at best a highermid range phone but is priced as a flagship at this point you might as well change the name of your company to two plus
youtube,bro really got me in the first part :loudly_crying_face:
youtube,i was also a fan but now i am switching to oneplus 15 or pixel 10 series
youtube,i wont buy it for 40k too pratik there are better options
youtube,prateek is not against the phone 3  hes against the iphone with 60hz at 80000
youtube,for a sec  honestly thought that he fell for it:face_with_tears_of_joy:
youtube,i feel like they can provide the headphone 1 for free like they did in bengaluru and then ship free fast chargers to all customers  provide some free 1 or 2 year subscription of chat gpt to somewhat sell this phone in india
youtube,this feels like a paid ad
youtube,finger print scanner well placed lol bye i am going

youtube,tag nothing  carl should review your video fr
youtube,paid promotion :clown_face:

youtube,i reely want carl pei to review this vid
youtube,tbh be a fan boy of nothing  and ended up to be nothing to buy nothing :face_with_tears_of_joy: going for samsung s24 ultra :grinning_face_with_sweat:
youtube,the ceo of nothing himself probably gonna make a separate reaction video on this video :face_with_tears_of_joy:
youtube,if they have decided to go all in on the price why not thrown in all premium hardware and do the sw optimizations later
youtube,ek unsubscribe to banta he  :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:
youtube,ya the new update is making my phone hot and changed the search bar from top to bottom:loudly_crying_face:
youtube,glif matrix what the battery drain fucking shit
youtube,agree with most of your takes except the price its a good phone for 45k if i was a huge nothing bro maybe good for 55k60k no way its worth 80k you can have oneplus 13 for less its a better phone in all but pure software experience
youtube,6:50 ekdum se waqt badal diye jazbaad badal diye:face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy:
youtube,at first i thought he was simply sugarcoating the nothing phone 3 especially after seeing carl peis reaction to other creators videos but towards the end he clarified his stance safe spot
youtube,would still choose this anyday over oneplus 13 :face_with_tears_of_joy:
youtube,that app install error is pretty common in nothing os my friend faced the same on his np 2a cred app wont get installed even the exteacted apk file wont get installed
youtube,i was ready to scold you and unsubscribe :face_with_tears_of_joy:  earned my respect :party_popper: 45k is the sweet spot for this phone
youtube,nothing phone3  a good phone but in 45k50k price segment  but worst phone in the price segment that it launched
youtube,the base varient of this phone should have been priced at 35k but they thought of playing with emotions and charging it more than twice at 80k
youtube,aapna sapna money money :moneymouth_face:
youtube,micromax could have really used the photo of the guy in orange tshirt
youtube,ill stay with my np1 that i bought in sale

youtube,click bate or wot
youtube,3a pro might be a better choice than this
youtube,even i dont believe this phone is to make sales to place their phone into premium category along with apple and samsung they already established budge a series and cmf for their bread and butter now they can build nothing brand to premium
youtube,i have a question about iphone how much would be the price of iphone 16 pro at big billion sale
youtube,but the fact is there cmf phone which comes under 20k  feels so smooth and feels like u are using flagship software even the performance is not that great but it feels like very nice  i shifted from mi sub flagship phone with 8 series processor and it performs very disgusting  after 115 years i have to switch to custom roms for smooth experience  at last i think for 99 of people want there day to day life task smoth not just specification
youtube,i was about to address the software issues half the way through the video but held back myself until i watch the full video glad you addressed it
youtube,still hate it
youtube,the lvl of sarcasm :face_with_tears_of_joy:
youtube,that was a googly :face_with_tears_of_joy:
youtube,the phone is quite greate on the design and user experience perspective but the only catch is price even if the price set between 45 to 50k it would have been still great but for the price right now in inida is surely a waste
youtube,i thought bro lost his marbles in the first part of the video
youtube,please do best phone under 20000 comparison as per different uses though i am a cmfnothing fan but i am afraid of buying cmf phone 2 pro for my mom  please hide my name if used in any video
youtube,even i said the same in nothing community thankfully the post wont reach no one
youtube,waiting for a reaction video by nothings ceo
youtube,its like they partially knew what they were doingsomehow still got the looks just right but effed up the pricing and other hardwaresi hope nothing dies because of bad decisions
youtube,bruh who the hell is gonna purchase this at 80k and s25 edge for 110k:skull::skull:
youtube,just say you like the sponsorship money
youtube,yo techwiser 4:20 wierd screenshot :face_with_tears_of_joy:
youtube,nothing phone 3 is launched to boost up 3a sales carl pei is making it complicated
youtube,commented within one hour checking to see if i get a reply:smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:
youtube,pratik i think you should compare phine 3 with poco f7 i want to see how my phone does against phone 3
youtube,day by day techwiser proves to be one of tech communitys sell out and suck up
youtube,i know pratik its ragebite
youtube,so cool transition :face_with_tears_of_joy:
youtube,if they give me money even i will like the phone
youtube,paid promotion  unexpectbly bad promo
youtube,i agree with you brother
youtube,this phones processor is more powerful than s24 ultra so i dont understand what the fuss is about
youtube,nothing ne paise :face_with_open_mouth:diye hai lgta hai :face_with_open_mouth: ye agar koi saare 30k wale phone 80k me hojaye too sb too accha hi rahega like this phone  :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:
youtube,tag nothing ceo
youtube,the uno reverse was slick
youtube,11:08 cause the shots were already fired at the phone 3 instead :fire:
youtube,manufactured in india but not for india
youtube,do you guys think nothing needs to move away from trying to be different because through its design language it has already established its point of difference does the brand need to get in line with some aspects to actually thrive in the industry
youtube,looll this looks like a sarcastic video
youtube,i like the design and specs just the pricing is bad especially for the indian market considering it is manufactured here
youtube,i waiting for oneplus 13s x xiaomi 15  x samsung s25and vivo x200 fe
youtube,for the first half i thought this video is sponsored by nothing :face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy:
youtube,usg gen 2 ltps display for 80k loved it
youtube,this is a 50k phone seriously i thought nothing has at least put their best effort in optimization and software development rather than specs i was soo wrong they were just sleeping for 3 years this phone doesnt feel like a 23 year development project feels more like 1 month rush :grinning_face_with_sweat:
youtube,overpriced like an iphone
youtube,i wanted nothing to succeed so badly but the decisions they made with the phone are just questionable like they removed ltpo that they had in phone 2 also the color shift stuff i can get past the fact they have to pay more for the stuff they have to get they are still kind of a new company but yeah kind of a let down fun fact the phone 3a cam out after i bought my edge 50 neo but cant do much of it now :loudly_crying_face:
youtube,i would consider this at 60k with nothing headphones bundled of course  now that indians know it sells for 68k in the usa:face_with_hand_over_mouth:
youtube,the video was for engagement farming :basket::grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:
youtube,he really got me in the first half i was about to throw hands i swear
youtube,nothing doesnt want you to buy this phone guys trust me this phone was released to just grab peoples attention even if that attention is hate they wanted people to talk about it :face_with_tears_of_joy:
youtube,ugly looking phone:pile_of_poo:
youtube,you were supposed to drop this before carls reaction on reviews:loudly_crying_face:
youtube,completely justified video i have been nothing user since the phone1 and i have been looking for an upgrade and they release this overpriced metal slab
youtube,i saw a comment: sponserwiser  looks like he didnt watch full video :face_with_tears_of_joy:
youtube,bro got the money from nothing for this review
youtube,can you suggest me a best phone under 40k with best software experience and camerahow about s24fe please let me know is there is anything better than s24fe
youtube,why do i want snap 8 elite because i pay 80000rs my brodhaar
youtube,80k and you get this :pile_of_poo: :crying_face:  in sale s24 ultra is st 80k  i would rather go with that or new iphones
youtube,hi prateek its high time that you start calling out the companies for giving usb 20 in any phone which costs 30k and above as the upcoming android 16 will be supporting desktop mode natively and not giving the hardware support even at 30k or above price level  shouldnt shouldnt be normal anymore and about nothing phone 3well all i have to say is that its going to be flop of the year 2025 carl is going to get the reality slap
youtube,we hate phone 3 because  if you go to buy a car for 10l and the showroom gives you an option of alto and nexon say both priced at 10lakh  will you still pick alto just because it has 4 wheels and a engine and does the job  phone 3 being priced same as apple and samsung and pricier than its actual competition oneplus we expect the fine things like ltpo gg victus sd 8 elite etc gliph is a extra gimmick so  it doesnt matter
youtube,if carl had so much obsession with the number 8 while setting the price in india he could have kept it 38kthatd make least sense to purchase this phone
youtube,nothing phone 4a   :thinking_face:price under 40000
youtube,best of all nothing phone 3 review on the internet
youtube,from now on i take techwisers reviews over mkbhds and i really hope carl pei reacts to this
youtube,phone 3 is shit:pile_of_poo: reason 3  1 over price  2 fked up design  3fake flagship phone and its shit like shit
youtube,nothing proves his name first time when the thing is already a shit what you would take good from the shit:face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy:
youtube,paneer posting
youtube,lmao the amount of people who havent watched the full video and calling them sponsored is hilarious
youtube,we surprised :anguished_face::anguished_face:but video is really good
youtube,i have purchased m35 for my father this year instead of going with m36 was it a good choice
youtube,i bet this video is 100 percent paid promotion
youtube,considering carl peis crazy obsession for hype seems like nothing never really actually expected and wanted to sell phone 3 but just wanted to create a buzz by being so bad in terms of value proposition by listing the phone at 2x price people discuss you when youre either too good or too bad not in between i know it sounds unconvincing but this is the closest possible explanation i can come up with for phone 3s flagship pricing for 40k midrange specs
youtube,is the samsung galaxy s24 or the iphone 14 still a good choice in 2025
youtube,payment received :grinning_face_with_sweat:
youtube,being a phone 2 owner makes me feel sad seeing the phone 3 not even 1 hardware is of flagship level
youtube,39999 thats it  not even for 40000
youtube,phone 4 will be 120k:face_with_tears_of_joy:
youtube,vote for compact gaming phone
youtube,ggmu
youtube,vote for compact gaming phone
youtube,this phone is over over and over priced
youtube,bro can you recommend me all rounder mobile in 35k budget
youtube,how much did they pay you
youtube,design is not a problem in this phone its expensive for the indian market for the features its offering  i remember carl mentioning usage of high quality expensive parts for this phone  but usage of cg glass 7i and ltps display optical fp scanner usb 20 these are unforgivable for that price  they recently spent a huge sum to buy the essential phone company maybe this is priced to counter that expense
youtube,at 8:27  the same issue happens with 3a as welleven though there is enough lighting the video looks less brighter
youtube,phew phew button
youtube,first launch it expensive then sell them with discounts well played nothing:check_mark_button::skull:
youtube,agreed
youtube,phone is ok price is far far from ok have been using nothing phone 2 since its launch now that i have found out that it has very poor resale value ill buy this when the used nothing 3 will be available around 25k which should be in less than one year after my experience with nothing phone 2

youtube,sir with all honestly tell me is this phone worth 80k
youtube,thats like a tech youtuber we want
youtube,they took 2 years to build this :pile_of_poo:
